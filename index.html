  <h2>About the Game</h2>
  <p><em>Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch</em> is a role-playing game developed by Level-5 in collaboration with Studio Ghibli. The game follows a young boy named Oliver who travels to a parallel fantasy world in order to save his mother and restore balance. The game blends storytelling, animation, and gameplay into a cohesive emotional experience.</p>

  <h2>Artistic Dimension</h2>
  <p>The artistic style of <em>Ni no Kuni</em> is heavily inspired by Studio Ghibli films, featuring hand-drawn animation, soft color palettes, and whimsical character designs. This visual style creates a sense of innocence and wonder that contrasts with the darker themes of loss and grief in the narrative. The art functions semiotically by signaling fantasy and emotional safety, even as the story explores trauma.</p>

  <h2>Technical Dimension</h2>
  <p>Technically, the game combines traditional animation techniques with 3D environments and real-time combat systems. The seamless integration of animated cutscenes and gameplay helps blur the line between watching and playing. This reinforces the illusion of immersion, making the game world feel continuous and alive rather than fragmented.</p>

  <h2>Interactive Dimension</h2>
  <p>Interactivity in <em>Ni no Kuni</em> centers on exploration, combat, and emotional decision-making. The player actively guides Oliver through battles and narrative progression, creating an affective bond with the character. Through repetition, learning, and failure, the player becomes emotionally invested, reinforcing theories of interactivity that emphasize participation over passive observation.</p>
