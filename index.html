    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section class="card" id="about">
      <h2>About the Game</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch</em> is a role-playing game by Level-5 that is widely known for its animation style and
        “storybook” feeling. It follows Oliver, a child dealing with a sudden personal loss, who discovers a pathway into a parallel world.
        From the beginning, the game links fantasy adventure to something very real: grief, fear, and the desire to undo what cannot be undone.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes the game stand out is that it refuses to become only dark or only cute. It holds both at the same time.
        The world is visually warm and inviting, but the plot keeps reminding you that the characters are struggling with brokenheartedness,
        manipulation, and the consequences of power. This tension is part of why the game is so memorable: it’s comforting without being shallow.
      </p>

    <!-- GAMEPLAY + STAKES (REQUIRED) -->
    <section class="card" id="gameplay">
      <h2>Gameplay and What’s at Stake</h2>

      <h3>Gameplay: what you do minute-to-minute</h3>
      <p>
        The gameplay centers on exploration, quests, and battles. You move through towns, forests, fields, and dungeons, talking to NPCs to
        learn what they need, then traveling to solve problems through fighting, item collection, puzzle-like tasks, and story progression.
        The game has the rhythm of a classic RPG: the world opens up over time, and the player’s skills expand as you learn spells and build a team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combat happens in real time, but it still asks for strategy. You manage actions, abilities, and healing while paying attention to the enemy’s behavior.
        A major system is the use of familiars, which turns battles into more than “just Oliver.” The player builds combinations of companions
        and learns what works together. That sense of learning and adjusting is important because it mirrors the story’s theme:
        you don’t move forward by magic alone—you move forward by practice.
      </p>

      <h3>Stakes: what the player is trying to prevent</h3>
      <p>
        The stakes begin with Oliver’s personal grief. His motivation is emotional before it’s heroic: he wants to make sense of loss and believes there might be a way
        to “fix” it. When the parallel world opens, the stakes expand into a collective problem: an evil force is damaging the hearts of people across the world,
        leaving them “brokenhearted.” The story turns this into a wider moral project, not just a personal wish.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s powerful about the stakes is that they are both symbolic and mechanical. Helping people isn’t just a cutscene—it’s connected to your progression.
        The game repeatedly asks the player to notice what’s missing in others and to take action to restore it. Because you’re doing it again and again,
        the theme becomes experiential: the game teaches care and persistence through the structure of play.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- NARRATIVE ARC (REQUIRED) -->
    <section class="card" id="arc">
      <h2>Narrative Arc (Beginning → Middle → Build-up)</h2>

      <h3>Beginning: a loss that changes everything</h3>
      <p>
        Oliver begins in Motorville, living an ordinary life until a tragic event results in the death of his mother. The opening is not just “backstory”;
        it’s the emotional core of the whole game. This isn’t a hero who starts with a destiny—he starts with a wound.
        The fantasy world becomes a place where he can act, learn, and attempt repair, even if repair is complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, Oliver is pulled into the parallel world with the help of Drippy, who functions like a guide but also like emotional balance.
        Drippy’s humor and warmth keep the tone from collapsing into despair. This matters because the player is asked to keep going—moving forward is the only option,
        and the game’s tone supports that movement.
      </p>

      <h3>Middle: learning magic, building relationships, restoring hearts</h3>
      <p>
        The middle of the story is a journey of learning and gathering. Oliver studies spells, meets allies, and visits new regions where the consequences of the villain’s
        influence appear in different forms. The narrative repeats a pattern: you arrive somewhere beautiful, discover a problem underneath it, and then help restore what has been harmed.
        This structure makes the world feel emotionally alive—places don’t just look different; they feel different because of the people in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oliver’s companions are important to the arc because they broaden the story from “one boy’s grief” to a shared mission. Their presence makes the story feel like a collective
        responsibility rather than a solo fantasy. Over time, the plot escalates from individual brokenheartedness to larger systems of control, fear, and corruption.
      </p>

      <h3>Build-up: confronting power and what it does to a world</h3>
      <p>
        As the game advances, the story becomes less about one “bad guy” and more about what despair can do when it becomes structural.
        The villain’s power is connected to emotional damage—people are not only threatened physically, they are drained, dulled, or manipulated.
        This is where the game becomes especially meaningful: it frames emotional harm as a world-shaping force, not a private issue.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- ENDING (REQUIRED) -->
    <section class="card" id="ending">
      <h2>How the Game Ends (Spoilers)</h2>

      <div class="spoiler">
        <p style="margin:0 0 10px;"><strong>Spoiler warning:</strong> The paragraphs below describe the ending.</p>

        <p>
          The end of <em>Ni no Kuni</em> resolves both the external conflict (defeating the main villain forces) and the emotional conflict (what Oliver learns about grief,
          responsibility, and restoration). The final stretch of the game escalates the threat beyond a simple duel: entire communities are endangered, and the world’s stability
          is shown as fragile when emotional harm spreads.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ending also reframes villainy. Instead of presenting evil as random, the game links it to history, despair, and the desire to control a world through fear.
          There is a strong sense that “brokenheartedness” is not only a status effect—it’s a metaphor for what happens when people lose connection to care, empathy, or hope.
          The game’s final conflict becomes a decision between destruction and restoration.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the climax and resolution, Oliver returns to his own world changed. The game does not pretend that loss never happened.
          What changes is Oliver’s capacity: he has practiced courage and care through action, and he brings that back with him.
          In that way, the ending isn’t only “winning”—it’s the idea that you can’t rewrite everything, but you can still rebuild yourself and your relationships.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="small" style="margin-top:12px;">
        If your professor wants the ending to name the final villain(s) and the final twist explicitly, tell me and I’ll rewrite this section with proper names while keeping it readable.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- READING CONNECTION (REQUIRED) -->
    <section class="card" id="analysis">
      <h2>Course Reading Connection: Why the Game Feels the Way It Feels</h2>

      <h3>Massumi: affect as intensity before emotion</h3>
      <p>
        Brian Massumi’s distinction between affect and emotion helps explain why <em>Ni no Kuni</em> feels powerful even in moments that are mechanically simple
        (walking, menu management, traveling between locations). Affect can be understood as intensity that hits you before you translate it into a named emotion.
        In this game, the orchestral score, the gentle pacing, and the soft visual design create a steady emotional pressure—like the world is always reminding you that it matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        This matters because the game’s themes could easily become either melodramatic or distant. Instead, the atmosphere keeps you inside the experience.
        Even when you aren’t in a cutscene, the game’s audiovisual design maintains a mood of tenderness + danger.
        That’s why the stakes feel continuous: the world never fully “turns off” emotionally, so you keep caring while you play.
      </p>

      <h3>Anzieu: an “envelope” that holds the player</h3>
      <p>
        Didier Anzieu’s ideas about the skin ego are useful here because they describe how our sense of self can feel supported by an enveloping structure.
        In <em>Ni no Kuni</em>, the world’s design acts like a supportive boundary: the music and storybook visuals create a kind of containment that makes the heavy subject matter playable.
        The player can approach grief indirectly through adventure, because the world itself feels stable enough to hold those emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        That containment is not the same as “happy” or “safe.” It’s more like a designed steadiness. The game lets you face fear without overwhelming you.
        It makes room for sadness while still offering beauty. In other words, the world is not only a setting—it’s a structure that shapes the player’s ability to keep going.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>In my view:</strong> sound + image + interactivity work together. The story provides meaning, but the atmosphere makes the meaning stick.
        The game teaches you how to feel through repetition and through the world’s constant mood.

    <!-- CHARACTERS (you wanted these kept + images) -->
    <section class="card" id="characters">
      <h2>Main Characters</h2>
      <p>
        These characters shape the emotional tone of the game. They aren’t just “party members”—they each represent a different way of moving through fear, grief, and responsibility.
        Their designs also reinforce the storybook style: soft shapes, warm color choices, and readable silhouettes that keep the world inviting even when the plot is intense.

    <!-- CONCLUSION (REQUIRED) -->
    <section class="card" id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion: Why This Game Is Compelling to Me</h2>
      <p>
        What I find most compelling about <em>Ni no Kuni</em> is that it treats hope like a practice. The game doesn’t say “get over it” and move on.
        Instead, it builds a world where helping others is part of healing—both emotionally and structurally.
        The player repeatedly learns that restoration takes time, attention, and willingness to keep showing up.

        The game’s sound and visuals are what make that practice feel meaningful rather than repetitive. The music and art direction create a stable atmosphere that supports the player,
        so even when the story is intense, the experience still feels approachable. That balance is why the game feels educational in an emotional sense:
        it teaches you how to carry sadness without being consumed by it.

        In the end, <em>Ni no Kuni</em> isn’t only memorable because it is beautiful. It’s memorable because its beauty has a purpose.
        It creates space for grief and fear, then uses interactivity to show that care and courage are things you build through action.
        That’s why the conclusion lands: the player doesn’t just watch change happen— they participate in it.
